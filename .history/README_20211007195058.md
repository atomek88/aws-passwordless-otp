## AWS passwordless auth with Cognito and Lambdas

structure:
/client - contains front end code deployed on http://otp-login-app.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

/lambdas - contains code from lambdas deployed as part of triggers in auth flow connected to Cognito

*Cognito User pool connected and configured to use 5 trigger lambda functions and app client /Ids added to front end configuration for cognito access

Improvements/Enhancements:
* Use serverless stack/cloudformation to deploy all lambdas with cognito user pool
* Add project lambdas and front end to CI/CD build CodeBuild CodeDeploy, add testing using a lambda testing framework to confirm services work locally before deploying
* Store credentials/email/resource IDs in a certificate manager/key vault system
* Provide additional UI interaction after User confirms OTP password - ie choose password, actual login to a landing page
* Configure logging and alerts for user email sign up, confirmation,  verification actions
* Depending on the future application/needs, integrate further with Amplify which should allow both FE, BE seamless deployments and additional app hosting features
